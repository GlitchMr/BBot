===Installing BBot===
There are various ways to install BBot, but the fastest way is to download a compressed file from the BBot project on Sourceforge.
Extract these files anywhere on your harddrive, and open a terminal.
When you are in the terminal, cd to the directory in which BBot is saved, and then into the BBot folder.
Then modify the config files to fit your needs.
Lastly, run the following command (without quotes):
"python bbot.py"

BBot should now be running on your system, but if it isn't, you can always ask for help in #bbot on irc.fossnet.info.
