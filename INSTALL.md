# Downloading BBot
There are various ways to download BBot, but the easiest way is to download a compressed archive from GitHub: <https://github.com/aj00200/BBot/archives/master>

# Installing and configuring BBot
Extract those files anywhere on your hard drive and open a terminal.
When you are in the terminal, change the directory (cd) to the one in which the BBot files are stored.
Afterwards, rename or copy the config-dist file to simply "config" and modify it to fit your needs.

# Running BBot
Lastly, run the following command (without quotes): `python bbot.py`

If you want it to keep running after you close the terminal, use a multiplexer such as GNU Screen.

BBot should now be running on your system, but if it isn't, you can always ask for help in #BBot on irc.fossnet.info.
